# Python API Starter Kit

## Introduction
Welcome to the Python API Starter Kit! This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive starting point for building Python-based APIs. It includes a well-structured folder layout, essential files, and basic setup instructions to kickstart your API development.

## Features
- Predefined folder structure for API components
- Sample code and placeholders
- Guidelines for best practices in API development
- Integration with popular Python frameworks (Flask/FastAPI)

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation
To set up this starter kit on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thinklikeacto/python-api-starter-kit.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd python-api-starter-kit
```
3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After installation, you can start using the starter kit to build your API. The project is structured as follows:

- `app/`: Main application directory
- `models/`: Data models
- `routes/`: API routes
- `services/`: Business logic
- `utils/`: Utility scripts and helpers
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `docs/`: Documentation files
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies

To run the API server, execute:

```bash
python app/main.py
```
